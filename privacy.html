    email petewil at live dot com for support.

    Since this is a free product, all support is best effort.

    The Breathe Meditation Timer does not send any user data to the app author or any third parties.

    If you choose to allow upload of mindfulness minutes to apple health, then the number of minutes
    meditated will be uploaded to apple health, and visible in the apple health app. Apple does not
    share this information with the app author.
