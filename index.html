    email petewil at live dot com for support.

    Since this is a free product, all support is best effort.  I may or may not have time to add
    any features you might request.  I do plan to fix all major bugs as I find out about them.

    I am currently considering adding the following features for someday
    <ol>
    <li> Custom bell sounds </li>
    <li> If custom haptics is ever supported on the watch, more interesting vibration options for intervals. </li>
    <li> A reset button </li>
    <li> Saving your meditation progress if you go to settings in the middle of a session. </li>
    </li> An option to turn off the phone screen while meditating, but keep playing sounds. </li>
    </li> If I can find an API to allow me to set personal focus while meditating, I will add a call to it. </li>
    </ol>
